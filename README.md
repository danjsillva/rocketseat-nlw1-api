# Ecoleta API

This is my project version of Next Level Week by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)

### Getting started

Instead of Express and Knex like the original proposal, **this version uses Koa and TypeORM**, but follows the same requirements.

You need:
- Node (v12 is recommended)
- NPM/Yarn

Before run dev server you need install dependencies and create database.

```
yarn
```

then

```
yarn typeorm:migrate
```

and finally
```
yarn dev
```

Enjoy it!
